## General description of the work

Our app is a Finnish municipalities learning app. It allows users to search for municipalities they already know and get statistics and information about them. They can also explore new municipalities according to different atributes such as highest population and highest imigration. There are a few minigames where the user can improve their knowledge on the municipalities and also they can compare two different municipalities with eachother.

## Division of labour

### Jussi Gr√∂nroos

#### The git history may not be represenative of the actual division of labour, as we both may have worked a single state, with only one of us committing the changes.
